            <p class="about"><B>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions. </B><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br>
                <B> For many patients, blood donors are their lifeline. One unit of blood can save three lives!<br>
                There are many reasons patients need blood. A common misunderstanding about blood usage is that accident victims are the patients who use the most blood. Actually, people needing the most blood include those:
                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbspHave Being treated for cancer.</li><br>
         <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Undergoing orthopedic surgeries.</li><br>
            <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Undergoing cardiovascular surgeries.</li><br>
                    <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbspHaveBeing treated for inherited blood disorders.</li><br>
